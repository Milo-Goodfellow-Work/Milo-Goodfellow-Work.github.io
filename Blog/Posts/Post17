A more than expected lazy day. That being said (BTW I don't use commas because right now that's how I delineate between different parts of posts) it was productive enough that I don't have to worry about it.
I completed everything I needed to stay on schedule (More than needed actually). There's now a GitHub page for the Gherkin tool: https://github.com/Milo-Goodfellow-Work/PracticeGherkinPython
