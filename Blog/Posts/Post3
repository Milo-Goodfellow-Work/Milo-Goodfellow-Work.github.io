Productivity and unproductivity are determined as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
Productivity must be conducive to achieving the long term goals I have IE:
		Practicing C programming
<br/>
<br/>
Unproductivity must not be conducive to achieving the long term goals I have IE:
		Viewing twitter
<br/>
<br/>
For either to be considered anything I must have chosen to do them, a family dinner is not unproductive. Following this, I can determine what is and is not a productive use of time.
