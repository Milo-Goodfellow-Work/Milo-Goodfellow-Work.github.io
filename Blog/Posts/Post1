I must be able to log my progress over time. The way I have done this in the past is a long log on twitter. However, this log didn't allow me almost any stylistic or programming freedom. This blog, on the other hand, offers me a massive amount of control over how things work. This and the fact I had just created a personal site guaranteed I would make the blog. So I have.
Please enjoy your stay!
